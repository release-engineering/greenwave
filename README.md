Greenwave is a service to decide whether a software artifact can pass certain 
gating points in a software delivery pipeline, based on test results stored in 
[ResultsDB](https://github.com/release-engineering/resultsdb) and waivers stored in 
[WaiverDB](https://github.com/release-engineering/waiverdb).
