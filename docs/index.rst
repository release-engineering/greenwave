=========
Greenwave
=========

`Greenwave`_ is a service to decide whether a software artifact can pass certain
gating points in a software delivery pipeline, based on test results stored in
`ResultsDB`_ and waivers stored in `WaiverDB`_.

**Gating** serves as a way to stop broken or non-compliant builds (RPM,
container image, module, composeâ€¦) from getting shipped to customers or getting
through other gating points (for example tagging a build as stable).
